  <h1>
    Flatland by Edwin A. Abbot
  </h1>
  <p class="summary">
    I call our world Flatland, not because we call it so, 
    but to make its nature clearer to you, my happy readers, 
    who are privileged to live in Space.
  </p>
  <p>
    Imagine a vast sheet of paper on which straight Lines, 
    Triangles, Squares, Pentagons, Hexagons, and other figures, 
    instead of remaining fixed in their places, move freely 
    about, on or in the surface, but without the power of 
    rising above or sinking below it, very much like shadows
    — only hard and with luminous edges — and you will then 
    have a pretty correct notion of my country and countrymen. 
  </p>
  <p>
    Alas, a few years ago, I should have said “my universe”: 
    but now my mind has been opened to higher views of things.
    In such a country, you will perceive at once that it is 
    impossible that there should be anything of what you call 
    a “solid” kind; but I dare say you will suppose that we 
    could at least distinguish by sight the Triangles, Squares, 
    and other figures, moving about as I have described them. 
  </p>
  <p>
    On the contrary, we could see nothing of the kind, not at 
    least so as to distinguish one figure from another. Nothing 
    was visible, nor could be visible, to us, except Straight 
    Lines; and the necessity of this I will speedily demonstrate.
  </p>
  <p>
    Place a penny on the middle of one of your tables in Space; 
    and leaning over it, look down upon it. It will appear a 
    circle. But now, drawing back to the edge of the table, 
    gradually lower your eye (thus bringing yourself more and 
    more into the condition of the inhabitants of Flatland), 
    and you will find the penny becoming more and more oval 
    to your view; and at last when you have placed your eye 
    exactly on the edge of the table (so that you are, as it 
    were, actually a Flatlander) the penny will then have 
    ceased to appear oval at all, and will have become, 
    so far as you can see, a straight line.
